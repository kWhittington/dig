# Dig
by Kyle Whittington

"Dig", is an arcade HTML game built with the Cocos2d-X Javascript library.

## Installation/Play
To run the game locally, use whatever preferred server software to host this directory.

To play the game in your browser, visit [http://kwhittington.github.io/dig/](http://kwhittington.github.io/dig/).

## Controls
The player is tasked with "digging" (via clicking and dragging) up dirt and gold blocks. Dirt blocks are to be placed in to the trash bin and gold blocks into the gold bin. If the blocks are sorted correctly, the player will be given some points. If the blocks are sorted incorrectly, the player will be penalized points and have their multiplier reset.

The player is allowed up to three mistakes before they are fired. The game will not stop until the player is fired; we have too much dirt and gold to sort to turn away help.

## Outside Tools
Cocos2D-X Javascript bindings were used to build the project and the default template was generated using the `cocos console` ([http://www.cocos2d-x.org](http://www.cocos2d-x.org)). All art assets are original and made using Pixen and Adobe Photoshop.

## Development
See `cocos --help` in terminal for any questions regarding `cocos console`.
